The Network Packet Analyzer is a C++ application that captures and analyzes network traffic in real-time. 1 It uses the libpcap library to capture packets from a specified network interface, parses the Ethernet, IP, TCP, and UDP headers, and displays key information like source/destination IP addresses and ports.
